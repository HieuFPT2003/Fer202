The former Belgium boss was not a universally-popular choice, but he's done an impressive job thus far, as his side won each of his opening 10 games in charge.Martinez is blessed with a group bulging with talent, and they should be extra motivated to perform for Cristiano Ronaldo, in what is likely to be his last-ever international tournament. But who made Portugal's 26-player Euro squad? GOAL takes a look...Portugal's defensive options are strong, too. Ruben Dias and Joao Cancelo are nailed-on starters at the back, while Manchester United star Diogo Dalot has proved a popular choice down the left-hand side of defence.The question of who will partner Dias at centre-back is more open. Martinez has flipped between a back four and back three since taking over, with youngsters Goncalo Inacio and Antonio Silva both receiving minutes. though the ageless Pepe remains an option, too.",
